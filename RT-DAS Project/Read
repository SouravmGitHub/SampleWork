This script was developed by me for Data Analysis by the DA Team. A small part of it has been presented here for demonstration purpose.
Input:- The script takes the CEMS data sheet from the Portal-(server) as input which has the per minute Particulate Matter -(PM) data values. 
Analysis:- The Analysis is done using Python Version: 3.9.7 & PANDAS Version: 1.4.0 as per CPCB guidelines and standards for PM. The Logic is derived from it. 
            It takes of all the required standards ranging from Data Availability to Data Quality for emission data collected from the analyzers. 
Output:- Post-Analysis the script generates an output in excel-sheet format (Final_Output) with all the details of the analysis.
