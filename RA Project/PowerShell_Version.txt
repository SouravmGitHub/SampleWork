# Scripting : PowerShell 5.0
# Sample of a script written by me to find the version of the code deployed to Service, Batch and Presentation Tier Servers.

# This is implemented by a Powershell Function -> Check_Version. The IP of the list of ST and PT Servers will be entered in the txt file by the Administrator. The script will display the Version of Code in each server in the list and the number of files present, post deployment.

# List of Batch-Tier Servers
$global:Batch_Servers = gc -Path D:\Scripts\XXXX\BatchTier.txt
